## Currently

I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Optics, University of Rochester studying computational microscopy. My dissertation work is in using angularly resolved light scattering, obtained via quantitative phase imaging and Fourier analysis, to study the size distribution of organelles in single cells.

## Selected Research and Industry Experiences

`2017 - present`
__PhD Candidate, Angular Scattering from Single Cells__, The Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, NY

- Measuring angularly resolved light scattering to size ensembles of organelles in single cells with a phase shifting
interferometry-based microscope.
- Designing and testing refractive index matching and digital processing methods to isolate organelle scattering
from undesired nuclear and cytoplasm signal.
- Programmed a 3D cell simulation tool to improve understanding of the limiting noise sources in extracting size
information from single cells, and to test ability to solve inverse problem in the presence of noise and
assumptions about model simplicity.

`May-Aug. 2019`
__Internship (NSF INTERN)__, Double Helix Optics, Boulder CO

- Tested and designed point spread function engineered phase masks for single-shot 3D imaging.
- Implemented algorithms to discard outliers in 3D point cloud rendering.
