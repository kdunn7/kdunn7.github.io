I am currently a PhD Candidate studying at the Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, where I use angularly resolved scattering from single cells to study organelle size distributions in single cells. In my free time, I coach Nordic skiing and mountain biking. I also enjoy racing in a variety of obscure endurance sports, including adventure racing, ski orienteering, and cyclocross.

## Research Interests:

- Computational microscopy
- Inverse problems in optics
- Physical optics
- Quantitative phase imaging
- 3D imaging of cells
- Light scattering
- Interferometry
- Holography
